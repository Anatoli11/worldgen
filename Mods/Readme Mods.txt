This is a placeholder for the mods folder

Mod: This folder will be the place where any external mods are kept 
and administrated. The idea is that an individual can customize aspects 
of the game, and these modifications will be organized and stored here. 
I have a few ideas on how this will work, but much more thought must go 
into it.
