    </div>
    <div class="summary-container">
      <ul class="summary-text">
        <li><b>1947 - </b>Born 10 August 1947, in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland.</li>
        <li><b>1959 - </b>Family moved to Blackpool, Lancashire, England.</li>
        <li><b>1963 - </b>Formed his first band, The Blades, with school friends.</li>
        <li><b>1964 to 1966 - </b>Studied fine art at Blackpool College of Art.</li>
        <li><b>1967 – </b>He abandoned his ambition to play electric guitar, allegedly because he felt he would never be "as good as Eric Clapton". At first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently.
          The Jethro Tull name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.</li>
        <li><b>1968 – </b>Jethro Tull records their first album, <b><i>This Was</b></i>. Anderson takes up flute which, after some weeks of practice, he found he could play fairly well in a rock and blues style. Referenced in the facetious liner notes for
          Thick as a Brick in a quote about "the one-legged pop flautist, Ian Anderson".</li>
        <li><b>1970 - </b>He married Jennie Franks, a photographer who is credited with some of the lyrics to the first couple of verses of the song "Aqualung". They separated in 1974.</li>
        <li><b>1973 - </b>Anderson appeared, along with several other artists, on the cover of Time, for an article about new directions in early 1970s music.</li>
        <li><b>1976 - </b>Married Shona Learoyd. They have two children: James Duncan Anderson, also a musician; and Gael, who works in the film industry.</li>
        <li><b>1983 – </b>Released his first official solo album called <b><i>Walk into Light</b></i>.</li>
        <li><b>1995 - </b>Released his second solo album, <b><i>Divinities: Twelve Dances with God</b></i>, an instrumental work composed of twelve flute-heavy pieces pursuing varied themes with an underlying motif.</li>
        <li><b>2000 – </b>Released the solo album <b><i>The Secret Language of Birds</b></i>.</li>
        <li><b>2003 – </b>Released the solo album <b><i>Rupi's Dance</b></i>, including a composition called "Griminelli's Lament", in honour of his friend, the Italian flautist Andrea Griminelli.</li>
        <li><b>2008 - </b>Was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).</li>
        <li><b>2011 – </b>Jethro Tull ends touring.</li>
        <li><b>2012 - </b>Produced a sequel to <b><i>Thick as a Brick</b></i> (1972), entitled <b><i>Thick as a Brick 2</b></i> or <b><i>TAAB2</b></i>. It is billed as being performed by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson instead of being a Jethro Tull album proper.</li>
        <li><b>2006 - </b>In recognition of his lifelong contribution to popular music, he received two honours in 2006: the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement and an honorary Doctorate of Literature at Heriot-Watt University.</li>
        <li><b>2011 - </b>He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Letters) from Abertay University.</li>
        <li><b>2013 - </b>At the Progressive Music Awards, he was presented with the "Prog God" award by fellow musician Rick Wakeman.</li>
        <li><b>2014 – </b>Released his most successful ever solo album, <b><i>Homo Erraticus</b></i>.</li>
        <li><b>2017 - </b>Released <b><i>Jethro Tull – The String Quartets</b></i>, a studio album by Ian Anderson featuring the Carducci String Quartet, conducted by John O'Hara.</li>

        <p class="quote-text">"I was a massive Tull fan from very young ... and, I hope, that too reflects in Rush. I was mesmerised by Ian Anderson. His presentation was simply magical and he delivered it with such a sense of humour and great style ... We [of Rush] saw it
          as a huge challenge to try and create something that can seem so dynamic onstage."</p>
