Folder that will contain constraints for the map and map generation. Sub-folders 
include the map graphics and map terrain type information. I envision the map as hex 
grid style with, in the beginning, the hexes being of one general type of terrain in 
terms of graphics, but the data underneath will be complex and variable. Iâ€™m hoping at 
some point to be able to generate the map graphics based on the terrain composition. 

There is a possibility of using Unity to build this in - I have to check that out.
