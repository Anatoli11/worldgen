/****** Object:  Table [dbo].[stTraitInfo]    Script Date: 2016-02-08 9:53:22 AM ******/
-- A table containing distinguishing qualities or characteristics which have the potential 
-- to modify a personâ€™s stats and game situations. 
--
-- There are three aspects: Mind, Body, and Soul
--Mind 
--    aptitude (constant)
--    learning (development) 
--    judgment (current)
--For the purposes of WorldGen intelligence and education will be the key drivers for discovery, 
--task ability, and cleverness and such. I plan to use sanity somewhat like the role-playing game 
--Call of Cthulhu where it is kind of a wild card, and will generally only go down over time. It 
--may also be used to calculate rationality for some decision-based scenarios.

--Body
--    mass (constant)
--    might (development)
--    vigour (current)
--They are all pretty self-explanatory, and provided the base model for the other two aspects.

--Soul
--    integrity (constant)
--    goodness (development)
--    character (current)
--The idea is that the soul realm is really a plus/minus with the higher numbers being the sphere of 
--good, middle numbers neutral, and low numbers bad/evil/immoral, which will be defined precisely 
--later. Perhaps it is an indication of your moral compass. We shall see.
