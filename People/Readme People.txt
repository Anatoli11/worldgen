/*People: This folder will contain static name and trait information for the inhabitants 
of the game. The data in here will be used by the initial generation process, and throughout 
the game to create people based on the specific rules and traits the player designs. Some of 
the key features are tribe names, tribe traits (political and personable), specific people 
traits available, possible personal afflictions, and vocations. 
*/

//***** To do list *****
//Done: Traits and stats will be base 100
//Current: Work through traits and stats
//Create an intial design for the data table for individuals
//Decide on the bell curve for each stat and trait
//Create functions for number generation
//Determine additional leader stats
//Decide if indivdual records will contain place-holders for leader information

//***** Name algorithm *****
//Generate script


//These may be under a different readme as they are functional for play
//Tech tree design
//Tech tree content
//Vocation list


//***** Other considerations *****
//Name caps must be done on generation - no manipulation in code
