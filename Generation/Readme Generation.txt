Generation: This folder will contain the initial generation routines and ongoing 
generation code. The idea is that after initial generation, this will be a regular 
series of routine that will manage the generation aspects of the world. Some of 
these include name and title generation, specific terrain generation types, and 
NPC (non-player character) generation.
